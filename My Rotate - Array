# Write a method, my_rotate!(array, amt), that accepts an array and a number as args.
# The method should mutate the array by rotating the elements 'amt' number of times. 
# When given a positive 'amt', a single rotation will rotate left, causing the first element to move to the last index
# When given a negative 'amt', a single rotation will rotate right, causing the last element to move to the first index
# The method should return the given array.
# Do not use the built-in Array#rotate
# 
# Note: this method must MUTATE the input array. This means that the object_id of the input array should be identical
# to the object_id of the returned array. The exact object_ids you get back don't matter. We just want the ids
# to be the same before and after calling your method.
